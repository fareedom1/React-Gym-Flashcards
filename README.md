# Web Development Project 2 - *Gym Exercise Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Fareed Uddin**

This web app: **is an interactive flashcard quiz for learning gym exercises and their target muscles. Users can click on a card to flip it between the exercise name and the corresponding muscle group. The app displays a title, a short description, the total number of cards, and allows the user to move to a random next card. The design includes a flipping animation for the cards and a subtle dumbbell-pattern background.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:


- [x] **The app displays the title of the card set, a short description, and the total number of cards**
  - [x] Title of card set is displayed 
  - [x] A short description of the card set is displayed 
  - [x] A list of card pairs is created
  - [x] The total number of cards in the set is displayed 
  - [x] Card set is represented as a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed**
  - [x] Only one half of the information pair is displayed at a time
- [x] **Clicking on the card flips the card over, showing the corresponding component of the information pair**
  - [x] Clicking on a card flips it over, showing the back with corresponding information 
  - [x] Clicking on a flipped card again flips it back, showing the front
- [x] **Clicking on the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text

- [ ] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - Example categories you can use:
    - Difficulty: Easy/medium/hard
    - Subject: Biology/Chemistry/Physics/Earth science

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added a smooth 3D flipping animation for cards
* [x] Implemented a custom dumbbell SVG background pattern with a dark overlay to improve visual design!
* [x] Responsive design using CSS aspect-ratio so cards keep their shape on different screen sizes.

## Notes

* Learning how to use useState effectively to manage both the current card index and flip state.
* Debugging random card generation to avoid picking invalid indices or repeating the same card.
* Figuring out the right CSS structure for the flip animation so that the entire card rotated, not just the text.
* Implementing a responsive background pattern and making sure it didnâ€™t overwhelm the cards..
